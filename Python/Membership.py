# Membership operaters = use to test whether a value is found in a sequence
# (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary)
# Membership operators are 'in' and 'not in'


# Example 1: Using 'in' operator
# words = "Apple"
# input = input("Enter a letter: ")
# if input in words:
#     print(f"{input} was found.")
# else:
#     print(f"{input} was not found.")

# Example 2: Using 'not in' operator

# words = "Apple"
# input = input("Enter a letter: ")
# if input not in words:
#     print(f"{input} was found.")
# else:
#     print(f"{input} was not found.")


# Example 3: Using 'in' operator with list object
# students = {"John", "Jane", "Doe"}
# input = input("Enter a student name: ")
# if input not in students:
#     print(f"{input} is not a student.")
# else:
#     print(f"{input} is a student.")

# Example 4: Using 'in' operator with dictionary object

# students = {
#     "John": "A",
#     "Jane": "B",
#     "Doe": "C"
# }
# input = input("Enter a student name: ")
# if input in students:
#     print(f"{input}'s grade is {students[input]}.")
# else:
#     print(f"{input} is not a student.")

# Example 5: Using 'in' operator with string
# email = "nempath@gmailcom"
# if "@" in email and "." in email:
#     print("Valid email")
# else:
#     print("Invalid email")
